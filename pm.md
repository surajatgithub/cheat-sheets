### STORY POINTS & MEANING

#### 0 – VERY QUICK TO DELIVER AND NO COMPLEXITY. IN MINUTES

-   One should be able to deliver many 0’s in a day
-   I know exactly what needs to be done, and it’s going to take me very little time
-   Example: Change color in CSS, fix simple query

#### 1 – QUICK TO DELIVER AND MINIMAL COMPLEXITY. AN HOUR

-   One should be able to deliver a handful of 1’s in a day
-   I know exactly what needs to be done, and it’s going to take me little time
-   Example: add field to a form

#### 2 – QUICK TO DELIVER AND SOME COMPLEXITY. MULTIPLE HOURS

-   One should be able to deliver one 2 comfortably in a day
-   I mostly know what needs to be done, where improvements/changes need to be implemented, and it’s going to take me some time
-   Example: Add parameter to form, validation, storage

#### 3 – MODERATE TIME TO DELIVER, MODERATE COMPLEXITY, POSSIBLE UNKNOWNS, ONE or MORE DAYS

-   On the order of about a day or more to deliver
-   I have a good idea what needs to be done, and it’s going to take me a bit of time
-   Example: Migrate somewhat complex static CSS into a CSS pre-processor

#### 5 – LONGER TIME TO DELIVER, HIGH COMPLEXITY, LIKELY UNKNOWNS, A WEEK

-   On the order of about a week or more to deliver
-   I know what needs to be done at a high level, but there is a good amount of work due to complexity/amount of development, and there are big unknowns we’ll - discover as we get into the work.
-   Example: Integrate with third-party API for pushing/pulling data, and link to user profiles in platform

#### 8 – LONG TIME TO DELIVER, HIGH COMPLEXITY, CRITICAL UNKNOWNS, MORE THAN A WEEK

-   On the order of a couple weeks+
-   I understand the concept and the goals, but it will take a while to deliver due to amount of work, complexity, and unknowns
-   If we have an 8, we should breaking them into smaller tasks/issues with smaller point values and minimize the complexity
-   This might require a Spike to architect/remove uncertainty, or be created as an epic with more granular stories within it
-   Example: Overhaul the layout/HTML/CSS/JS of a web application

#### 13 – LONG TIME TO DELIVERY, HIGH COMPLEXITY, MANY CRITICAL UNKNOWNS, MANY WEEKS/MONTHS

-   On the order of many weeks/month
-   Similar to an 8; this should definitely be an epic, and requires discussions around how to accomplish
-   Example: Migrate application from an outdated data store to new DB technology and ORM

#### 21 – YOU’RE DOING THIS WRONG
