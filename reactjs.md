# Instalation

1. Install NPM
2. Install React
   ```sh
   $ npm i -g create-react-app@1.5.2
   $ npm install -g create-react-app
   ```
3. Install Visual Studio code
4. Add "Simple React Snippets" extension
5. Add "Prettier code formatter" extension

# Create react app

```sh
$ create-react-app react-app
```

# Run React App

```sh
$ npm start
```

Navigate to localhost:3000

# Router
```sh
import React from "react"; 
import ( BrowserRouter, Route, Switch ) from "react-router-domes"; 

import StorePicker from "./StorePicker";
import App from "./App";
import NotFound from "./NotFound"; 

const Router = => (
    <BrowserRouter> 
        <Switch>
            <Route exact path="/" component= (StorePicker) />
            <Route path="/store/:storeId" component= () />
            <Route component=fNotFound/ />
        </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter> 
)
export default Router;
```

# React concepts
1.  Virtual DOM
2.  Components
3.  Unidirectional Data flow
4.  UI, The rest is upto you (Library, Reusibility across the mobile, web, desktop apps, VR etc)

# React keywords
1.  Declarative
2.  State
3.  JSX
4.  Props (Property)
5.  Components
6.  Virtual DOM

# The job og React developer
1.  Decide on Components (Re-usability)
2.  Decide the State where it lives
3.  What changes when State changes

# Getting Started
cmd: npx create-react-app monsters-rolodex
cmd: yarn start

# Tools
1.  Babel
    -   It is used for the browser copatibility of your code
2.  Webpack
    -   It minifies and bundles our imported js, css into build directory

# Directory architecture
-   Build
    -   This directory holds hte producion version of your code
-   SRC
    -   This is our workbook and hold our all the code written by you

# Import components
```h
export const CardList = () => {
  return <h1>jjjjjj</h1>;
};
import { CardList } from "./components/card-list/card-list.component";
```
```h
export default CardList = () => {
  return <h1>jjjjjj</h1>;
};
import CardList from "./components/card-list/card-list.component";
```

# Tips
1.  Get the child elements of parent component `({props.children})`

# React upgrade
$ yarn list react react-dom react-scripts [To check the version of the given packages]
$ make changes to you package.json file and use ^ sign before package version so that it will instal latest stable version without breaking
$ yarn install

# React lifecycle methods

### constructor()
-   When components loads for the first time
-   It is used for Initializing local state by assigning an object to this.state.
-   It is used for Binding event handler methods to an instance.

### render()
-   The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted.
-   The render() method is the only required method in a class component.
-   The render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time itâ€™s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.
-   If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in componentDidMount() or the other lifecycle methods instead. Keeping render() pure makes components easier to think about.

### componentDidMount()
-   It get invoked just after the render()
-   It is like the ready method from JQUERY
-   You can write all you inits here and also API call if there any
-   componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.

### componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
-   It gets onvoked when any update happen to state or new props comes in
-   componentDidUpdate() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.

### shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
-   It gets invoked when componnent gets updated
-   Here you can decide if you want to render() and componentDidMount() by returning true or false

# React Routing
<!-- https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start -->
### Link
### withRouter
### Route
### Switch
### BrowserRouter
-   Link does not add URL to history
-   Router given us access to history, location, match params from props
-   We can push urls manually using history.push method on click event
-   props,match helps us create nested route structure
